		<h1>Rules for osmc.teengamingnights.net</h1>
		<aside><i>Last revised 21 April, 2020; added section j and k to Rule 3.</i><br><br>The TeenGamingNights.net Minecraft server has a set of rules in place to ensure it's fun for everyone. Please read these rules carefully to avoid punishment; ignorance of these rules is not an excuse for breaking them and will not circumvent you from any action.<br><br>While they try to be, our rules cannot be 100% comprehensive. The use of loopholes that violate the spirit of the following rules is subject to punishment.<br><br>Our server has extensive logging from inventories to block data, so please refrain from breaking the rules for your own sake.<br><br>Moderators reserve the right to act on a case-by-case basis. If you feel something is unfair, want to see something changed, have a question, or if you're just not sure if your submission breaks the rules, do not hesitate to message the moderators either in-game or on Discord. We're here to help!</aside>

	<h2>Rule 1. No personal attacks.</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>a. Racism, sexism, ageism, homophobia, transphobia and other hatred-based commentary are prohibited. This includes using discrimination, slurs, and derogatory words.</li>
            <li>b. Ad-hominem attacks taking the place of respectful discussion will be removed.</li>
            <li>c. Threats of real-world or online action against other players are not allowed and will be treated severely.</li>
            <li>d. Sharing personal/private information about yourself and/or others is strictly forbidden.</li>
            <li>e. Hate-based commentary excused as a joke will never be considered acceptable, and users will be subject to the same punishment as if it was said in all seriousness.</li>
        </ul>
    <aside>We want our server to be a fun and safe environment for everyone where they can freely communicate and interact. Our server is survival with PvP enabled, which can cause actions and words to be heated. Please keep actions and words civil. If you make the server an undesirable place in chat, you will be asked to leave. Continued harassment should be reported to the moderators. However, it is only considered harassment if it is prolonged. Harassment does not include a group response to a player's death or a bounty regarding a player's death, rather prolonged unprovoked violence and attacks in chats. Try to find a common ground and settle differences without the need for moderator intervention.</aside>
    
    <h2>Rule 2. No spamming.</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>a. Distribution of IP addresses, invite codes, URLs, etc. of other gaming communities and their respective services that may follow - VOIP services/servers, website, game servers, forums, social media, private Minecraft servers, etc., not related to an organization within TGN (such as a town, group, base, or alliance) is strictly forbidden.</li>
            <li>b. Spam is strictly forbidden. Messages by a user(s) in a short amount of time with the intent to spam and clog a public channel is not allowed. Message line spamming is also unacceptable.</li>
            <li>c. Abuse of chat formatting is unacceptable. You may not abuse chat formatting to make fake player messages or ban/mute messages. Characters that lag chat or clients are not permitted.</li>
        </ul>
    <aside>Repeatedly misusing a chat channel could result in a temporary mute, or in extreme cases, a temporary ban from our services. If you have any questions, feel free to message a moderator for more clarification.<br><br>A mute translates to a mute from all channels, including global, and local chat, for any reason.</aside>
    
    <h2>Rule 3. No griefing other claims and creations.</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>a. Removals, additions, or alterations of others' builds, entities, and property claims on private land is strictly forbidden. Structures such as lavacasts or lavawalls that are intentionally built near another player's claim will be removed. Surrounding another player's claim with your owns is forbidden and your claim will be dissolved. </li>
            <li>b. Luring mobs, placing blocks, removing blocks, making redstone contraptions, bed/ender crystal bombing, etc. that circumvents a player's private chest protection and/or property claim is strictly forbidden.</li>
            <li>c. When removing a user from a claim, if possessing the authority to do so, a minimum of 7 days notice must be given for them to remove their belongings. The way to do this is to leave a sign outside of a player's claim with the date on it and eviction notice on it. Do not remove the notice and claim after 7 days until permitted to do so from a moderator.</li>
            <li>d. Using the /sethome command or setting a bed spawn point within another player's claim is forbidden.</li>
            <li>e. Annexing a town requires permission from the owner(s) of the town; however, you will still need to do a formal eviction for all players you wish to evict. You are not required to evict players when gaining ownership of a town.</li>
            <li>f. Using mobs, redstone machines, explosions, etc. outside normal combat that negatively impacts a player on their own claim or a public claim is prohibited (e.g. Withers in the Nether Hub).</li>
            <li>g. Usage of chorus fruit or enderpearls to access a property claim that would normally be inaccessible is forbidden.</li>
            <li>h. A player is permitted to place blocks in a claim that, in turn, can be broken by an opposing party if those two players are engaged in combat. In essence, think of Fortnite's build mechanics, you're permitted to build a wall, but not an entire structure that would be semi-permanent or difficult to take down.</li>
            <li>i. A player can be attacked and is permitted to attack other players in a property claim.</li>
			<li>j. A player inactive from the community or banned for more than 30 days, will lose their Nether Hub claim.</li>
			<li>k. A player with an unnecessarily large claim in the Nether Hub that is not actively being used to its full extent will have their claim downsized after reasonable notice from the moderating team.</li>
        </ul>
    <aside>Removing blocks or placing blocks to gain access where you normally wouldn't be able to is forbidden, even if you revert the changes you have made. However, a player is permitted to place blocks in a claim that, in turn, can be broken by an opposing party if those two players are engaged in combat. This is to ensure that if players decide to attempt to protect themselves while in combat, an opposing party can still attempt to continue the fight.<br><br>Property claim borders extend vertically in the End and the Overworld. Problems arising from land claims will be dealt with on a case by case basis, but as a general rule please keep a reasonable length away from other players' land, unless you have received permission from the landowner. A rule of thumb is not to be within the view distance set by the server.<br><br>If you have entered someone's private property legally and are attacked by a hostile mob, you have the right to kill it in self-defense. This is only allowed if you did not provoke the mob - hitting a player who has a wolf and then killing the wolf is legal, but hitting a wolf and then killing it is illegal. This means that automatically hostile pets such as ghasts in private property are legally allowed to be killed in self-defense.<br><br>Naturally generated structures can be privately claimed and must be marked off as such with proper signage and/or locked entrances and exits. The only exception to this rule is strongholds (end portals) due to their limited amount in a given Minecraft world. Items dropped when a player dies is considered free-realm for any player to pick up and keep if the player dies due to legitimate causes. Items that are dropped by breaking blocks (including but not limited to ores, blocks, and shulker boxes) are not free-realm for other players to pick up. Interfering in a trade by taking dropped items involved is forbidden and treated as scamming.<br><br>Public containers (chests or shulkers) not protected with LWC's chest protection system are considered free-realm for any player to take or take items from. If you are considering having a public door, or public chest, please familiarize yourself with LWC's commands and this rule section to properly set your containers for the intended use as a public or private container. Having a public chest inside a locked building or settlement is still considered free-realm, as long as the player gained access to the locked area legally. Containers that cannot be locked themselves - without the use of a sign, e.g. hoppers, item frames, armor stands, are never free-realm without the owner's consent. A guide to using LWC properly can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/pop4959/LWCX/wiki/Getting-Started">link</a>.</aside>
    
    <h2>Rule 4. No inappropriate usage of modded gameplay.</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>a. Modified game files and scripts that give you an unfair advantage, i.e. cheats, or cracked client, and/or are not explicitly permitted is strictly forbidden. Enhancements beyond human capability, such as an autoclicker or auto-targeter, are not allowed. Some modified game files are allowed and clarified below.</li>
            <li>b. Using any disallowed in-game, e.g. x-ray, or item duplication, or server-based glitches, i.e. permission misconfiguration, is strictly forbidden.</li>
            <li>c. Bypassing AFK checks is strictly forbidden.</li>
            <li>d. Intentionally or unintentionally causing lag, i.e. FPS lag, TPS lag, etc., is strictly forbidden. Larger mob farms can cause lag to the server, and moderators reserve the right to remove, freeze farm AI, or change the farm.</li>
        </ul>
    <aside>This includes any modification(s) made to your Minecraft client, computer, or mouse through the use of auto-click/burst clicking macros or buttons. Modifications which alter the way that your client sends data to the server are also strictly disallowed, even if they fall into an allowed category. You also cannot circumvent any AFK checks with the usage of a physical item - a physical item lodged in between the keyboard or mouse to mimic legitimate player movement. Essentially, you must be interacting with the game and be responsive to any in-game behavior. Using in-game mechanics and structures to play the game is permitted - redstone grinders and mob farms fall under this category, using external factors are not - this is not limited to but can be botting or macros. Distribution of exploitations or behaviors that are against the server's goals or rules is strictly forbidden.<br><br>Allowed modifications are:
    <ul>
        <li>Client performance improvement mods, e.g. FPS improvement mods, OptiFine, etc.</li>
        <li>Aesthetic modifications, e.g. shaders mods.</li>
        <li>HUD mods, e.g. Armor Status, Effect Status, HudPixel, Shulker Tooltip, Orderly (Healthbar), 5Zig, Schematica, Light Overlay, etc.</li>
        <li>Brightness and gamma adjustment mods.</li>
        <li>Minimap mods that do not show caves, and other entities.</li>
        <li>Item sorting mods, e.g. InventoryTweaks.</li>
        <li>Recipe assistance mods, e.g. Just Enough Items.</li>
        <li>Waypoint mods.</li>
        <li>VR Mods, e.g. Vivecraft.</li>
    </ul>
    Any other categories of modifications should be treated as prohibited modifications.<br><br>If you have any doubt that a modification or glitch you want to use is allowed, please ask a staff member before using it - and they will update this list accordingly.<br><br>Prohibited modifications functionality will result in a warning, temporary ban, or indefinite ban depending on the severity.</aside>
    
    <h2>Rule 5. No inappropriate content.</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>a. Content that falls under this term include player skins and capes, usernames, titles, pixel art, map art, drawings, and builds. This content cannot be inappropriate and must be safe for work as a point of reference.</li>
            <li>b. Entity, item usage (signs, etc.), and item names may be inappropriate but must not include any hatred-based commentary - see Rule 1. a.</li>
        </ul>
    <aside>Our definition of inappropriate: sexually suggestive, nude, gore, erotica, offensive, repulsive, obscene, graphic, etc., content is within our terms of inappropriate.</aside>
    
    <h2>Rule 6. No disregard for player and account safety.</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>a. You may not use any kind of staff-related words in your title, including rank names (administrator, moderator, etc.), and staff usernames.</li>
            <li>b. Sharing of your Minecraft account on our server is not allowed.</li>
            <li>c. Using multiple accounts to play on our server is not allowed, also known as alternate "alt" accounts. Please pick one main account, any alternate accounts are permanently banned.</li>
            <li>d. Phishing links, IP loggers, URL shorteners, and other similarly malicious acts is strictly forbidden through any method.</li>
            <li>e. Chargebacks of purchases made through the store is forbidden. A permanent ban will be automatically administered to players that chargeback their purchase.</li>
        </ul>
    <aside>For example, setting your username to TheNooobWar or changing your title to [M] or [A] would be considered staff impersonation. This is unacceptable and would be subject to punishment.<br><br>As a Minecraft server unaffiliated with Mojang AB, we do not have any control over your Minecraft account. However, player safety is very important to us, so where possible we take steps to help protect our players from losing their accounts or otherwise being tricked or subjected to scams.<br><br>Please do NOT share your Minecraft account details with anyone else. You are responsible for what happens to your account so make sure that your passwords are secure and that you never give them out to anyone.<br><br>We recommend you: use unique strong passwords (preferably randomly generated), use security questions with your Mojang account, use two-factor authentication (2FA) with your email address if your email provider supports it, and most importantly, <b>do not share</b> your account information with <b>anyone</b>.</aside>
    
    <h2>Rule 7. Miscellaneous and Player Traps.</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>a. Players intentionally aiding others in breaking the rules will be equally punished for the actions of the people they are aiding. In the case of trading, as long as the seller is unaware, selling items to a player which are later used in an illegal activity will result in no punishment towards the seller.</li>
            <li>b. Scamming other players with in-game deals or services is forbidden.</li>
            <li>c. Traps which are manually activated by a player are allowed to kill and loot other players as long as there is a legal method of escape. In essence, if the trap does not kill and prevents the player from continuing without the need to /spawn or /home, it is forbidden. This trap does not have to be manually activated by the creator, and for example can be activated by the trapped player through usage with redstone plates.
                <ul>
                    <br>There are three elements that most traps on TGN possess. A trap is legal as long as it does not possess all three elements. These factors are as follow:<br><br>
                    <li>i. The trap is knowingly, consciously entered by a player. An example would be a room that the player walks into.
                    <li>ii. The trap puts the player in combat. An example would be a lava pit.
                    <li>iii. The trap is not escapable without griefing. An example would be a trap that pushes a block above you once you fall into it.
                    <br><br>A legal trap will never fill all three of these elements, but a trap may have two. The only exceptions to this rule are nether portal traps or unescapable traps that continue to damage the player, preventing them from using /spawn to escape. Examples of a trap like that would be an entity cramming trap. Magma block traps do not fall under that category.<br><br>
                </ul>
            <li>d. Combat logging is forbidden and will be punished by your character's death on disconnection. This includes any disconnection out of the player's control - for example, ISP issues or power outage.</li>
            <li>e. Moving another player outside of PVP protected zones, by any means, is forbidden.</li>
        </ul>
    <aside>Traps on your claimed property are permitted, but they cannot affect or change public land you do not own or another's private land. If a trap is truly inescapable and no moderators are online, the trapped player has the right to break free themselves. However, if the trapped player abuses this privilege or it is found the trap was easily escapable, they will receive the appropriate griefing charge.<br><br>A trap is considered "inescapable" if it can only be escaped using illegal methods, another player, the trap creator, death, or a moderator. For example, creating a locked room in which a player is exposed to lava, thus triggering the combat log check preventing them from using commands, and no way out is illegal. The same applies to suffocation traps. Fall traps are allowed as long as they are escapable using either a command or other legal method from the bottom. A scenario in which a trapper traps a player in a room with their home set, and constantly returns home to trap the player in a combat timer loop is also illegal. If you have questions about the legality of a trap, please contact a moderator.</aside>
